# UnityRelativityScripts

This is the remains of a project I started working on in late 2019. 

## A note to RPI OSS graders
I did upload this proejct hoping to get some credit for the Open Source Software class, but
I don't want to be dishonest and act like I wrote all this code this semsester. This branch
exists as a baseline of my code in its inital state before I cleaned it up, and improved the
doccumentation so you can grade me fairly based on progress made this semester.
